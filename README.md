# Hybrid-Query-Processing-System
Relational databases have been used for long time and also
currently being used by several organizations for many applications. Relational databases excel at handling structured data and they follow
the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) properties. But they are very less flexibility in terms of structure. To overcome this
NoSQL databases came into existence. NoSQL databases are fast, they
provide great flexibility for storing unstructured data and they can be
scaled horizontally in a very convenient way. It has several variants like
Key-Value store, Document store, Column oriented, Graph based, Triple
store etc. Though they offer great scalability and flexibility, they sacrifice
the ACID properties to become more flexible. Thus, both have their own
advantages and drawbacks. Our application aims at combining the
merits of both databases through a query analyzer which could act as a
virtual querying agent for both Relational (MySQL) and NoSQL databases
(MongoDB).
